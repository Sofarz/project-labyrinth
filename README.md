# Project Labyrinth
This was a project build during the Technigo bootcamp. Week 16. It consisted in building a game in the form of a text based adventure. The main goal was to practise:

- How to make API calls around Redux using thunks
- How to structure your redux store to suit your data
- To send JSON in the body of a request

## The problem

- We started by exploring Postman and its feature. 
- We split up the project into different components to try to make each page as clean as possible.
- We wanted to add an error message, warning the user if the username was already used, but it turned out   not to be possible with this API. Therefore, the user need to type an unique username on restart.
- We used nes.css and styled components to practise a different way to style.
- If we had more time we would have wanted to try out more of the stretch goals especially localStorage. We tried but didn't manage to get it to work.
